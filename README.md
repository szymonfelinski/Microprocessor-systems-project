# Microprocessor-systems-project
An Arduino Simon-says-type game

This project was made during my 6th semester of Engineering degree.
9 buttons connected using a resistor ladder and 9 multiplexed LEDs, both creating side-by-side, 3x3 matrices.
Upon start a sequence is displayed on the LED matrix and the player is supposed to repeat the sequence using the buttons matrix.
Correct sequence shows alternating O and K, an incorrect sequence displays X on the LED matrix.
